## *Description*  
<br>
<br>

COFFEE HUB is a place where gourmet coffee houses can be located when on the go.

Technologies used in building this site were HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

<br>
<br>

## *Instructions*  
<br>

To view the site click on  GitHub deployed link at bottom of README.

When entering the site, the viewer is presented with header containing the site logo, search bar and navbar of icon links, a sidebar of  

navigable icons and in the center the main page containing multiple rows of thumbnail images of client businesses.   

The nav bar provides highly visible icons that link to advertisers of the site and when cursor hovers, suggestions appear for the viewer.

Examples included are icons of  Uber Eats and Door Dash that link to their businesses with hover message to viewer 'order here'  giving   

viewer ability  to  use sponsor's business to order in some coffee,  and  icon that links to Lyft with a hover message of 'catch a ride'  

giving the viewer the ability to use the advertiser's business to visit one of the client's locations.   

The side bar has vertical row of clickable icons.

The main body contains images of the client's coffee houses along with location, link to client's about page, date of establishment,  

total views and date of last update. 

<br>
<br>

Future developments include the ability for the viewer to click on coffee house thumbnail and navigate to an about page designed by the  

client and providing the client with the ability to continuously update their own page as desired.

Another feature will be databases linked to the sidebar icons that will provide viewers with the ability to build lists of favorites and  

access various coffee house databases.
